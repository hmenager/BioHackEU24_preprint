# Abstract


This project seeks to enhance the ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem (RSEc) by increasing the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR principles) of Bioconductor’s extensive collection of over 2,000 bioinformatics packages. By aligning Bioconductor metadata with the EDAM ontology and integrating detailed package descriptions into the bio.tools registry, this project will significantly improve the search, discovery, and usability of genomic data analysis tools within the R environment. The short-term goals involve mapping EDAM terms to Bioconductor’s biocViews taxonomy, developing a gold standard of manually annotated packages, and assessing tools for automated EDAM term suggestions. Long-term, we aim to expand EDAM coverage to the full Bioconductor ecosystem, phase out biocViews, and implement an automated synchronisation mechanism with the bio.tools registry. This initiative also fosters a collaborative pathway between the Bioconductor and ELIXIR communities, promoting sustainable and scalable software management within the European bioinformatics infrastructure.

TODO: Summarize key results, including outcomes from EDAM term mapping, curation insights, and future directions for complete bio.tools integration.

# Introduction

Bioconductor is a globally recognized open-source project that provides over 2,000 packages for high-throughput genomic data analysis within the R programming environment. These tools support a vast range of bioinformatics applications, from differential gene expression analysis to visualization and data integration, making Bioconductor a critical resource for life sciences research. However, with the expansion of bioinformatics resources, there is a growing need for improved methods to locate and apply appropriate tools, particularly in complex data workflows.

The ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem (RSEc) supports the FAIR principles—Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability—and offers a structured approach to organizing bioinformatics tools through the bio.tools registry and the EDAM ontology. By aligning Bioconductor packages with these standards, we aim to enhance the discoverability and usability of these resources within the broader bioinformatics community.

This project focuses on mapping the biocViews taxonomy to EDAM terms, curating a subset of Bioconductor packages with manual annotations, and establishing pathways for automated synchronisation between Bioconductor and bio.tools. In addition to advancing the EDAM standard, this project will lay the groundwork for sustainable collaboration between the Bioconductor and ELIXIR communities. Through structured integration and community-driven development, this initiative represents a foundational step toward a cohesive and accessible bioinformatics ecosystem.


# Results


## Mapping biocViews terms with EDAM

Our work focused on mapping biocViews terms to the EDAM ontology, identifying gaps and inconsistencies between the two vocabularies. Unlike EDAM, biocViews is not structured as an ontology and has a broader, less standardized scope, which presents challenges in mapping specific concepts. This process revealed areas where EDAM could be extended or refined to better represent the domain covered by biocViews.

Some pre-hackathon groundwork on biocViews-to-EDAM mapping was performed using the `text2term` Python package, with preliminary results available [here](https://vjcitn.github.io/biocEDAM/articles/biocEDAM.html#a-preliminary-comparison-of-the-vocabularies). Building on this effort during the hackathon, the "biocViews mapping"" sheet ([linked here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/155rJX5pUPFDIQNsX0AsohEjFjxfJ9za54b45V9gtQzg/edit?gid=1016157783#gid=1016157783)) now contains detailed annotations. The “mapping” column includes ongoing manual reviews with categories such as "mapped and relevant," "mapped but not relevant," "not mapped but mappable to EDAM term," "not mapped and no equivalent in EDAM," and "not mapped and out of EDAM scope."


## Defining reference set of packages

We created an initial reference set of Bioconductor packages, accessible in the “Package list” sheet ([link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/155rJX5pUPFDIQNsX0AsohEjFjxfJ9za54b45V9gtQzg/edit?gid=1269194852#gid=1269194852)). This includes well-known, heavily downloaded packages, as well as those suggested by project contributors and developers. The “Package curation” table ([link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/155rJX5pUPFDIQNsX0AsohEjFjxfJ9za54b45V9gtQzg/edit?gid=1035911148#gid=1035911148)) was developed for annotating these packages with EDAM terms, to improve discoverability and integration with bio.tools. Contributors are encouraged to help populate the “should they be in bio.tools?” column and further refine the annotations.

Several package developers also reviewed and updated EDAM annotations in bio.tools for their packages, providing curated examples for future work, including:

- [xcms](https://bio.tools/xcms)
- [BridgeDbR](https://bio.tools/bridgedbr)
- [rWikiPathways](https://bio.tools/rwikipathways)


## Integrate Bioconductor packages into ELIXIR RSEc

We have now incorporated Bioconductor metadata into the ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem (RSEc) framework , with automatic weekly updates to facilitate ease of maintenance and integration. See [details here](https://github.com/research-software-ecosystem/content/tree/master/imports/bioconductor).


## Automate EDAM suggesting terms for Bioconductor packages

Prototyping is underway for a tool to automatically suggest EDAM terms based on Bioconductor package content, with initial explorations documented in [this vignette](https://vjcitn.github.io/biocEDAM/articles/curate.html). Following these explorations, a need was identified to refactor the Python code in [biocEDAM/inst/curbioc](https://github.com/vjcitn/biocEDAM/blob/main/inst/curbioc/curbioc.py) to streamline and modularize functionality, leading to the development of the `edamize()` function. Demonstrated on an MSnbase vignette, `edamize()` marks an important step toward automating EDAM annotations, though it currently lacks robustness and requires further refinement. 

A potential enhancement was proposed to streamline EDAM annotations: adding a [custom field in the DESCRIPTION file](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#sec-description-custom-fields) for Bioconductor packages, allowing for EDAM terms (e.g., topics, operations, data types) to be recorded directly within the package metadata. Additionally, the [creation of a roclet](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/extending.html#creating-a-new-roclet) would enable developers to annotate packages with these EDAM terms directly in their code, using the Roxygen tool they already use for documentation. This approach would generate a structured metadata file similar to the operations graph in [bio.tools for xcms](https://bio.tools/xcms), allowing Bioconductor packages to be more precisely described for integration into bio.tools and enhancing discoverability within the ELIXIR ecosystem.


## Enhancing user querying of tools

A prototype of a [BioChatter](https://biochatter.org/) module was initiated to leverage the bio.tools API, enabling users to query Bioconductor package information more intuitively. The module interprets natural language questions, translates them into bio.tools API calls, and retrieves relevant package details based on EDAM terms and other metadata. This approach is intended to support complex, context-specific queries, enhancing users' ability to identify suitable Bioconductor tools for particular bioinformatics applications.

To advance BioChatter, we are seeking specific user questions and expected outcomes to develop well-defined use cases. These examples will guide the API’s natural language processing capabilities and refine responses, ensuring alignment with user needs.
